# LFI Vulnerability Checker

Explore LFI vulnerabilities via a Flask app, and Engage with an LFI-prone Flask site and validate web apps for LFI susceptibility using a Tkinter-driven scanner.

# Features

This tool features a vulnerable Flask web application for LFI demonstration and a Tkinter GUI for user-friendly LFI vulnerability testing.

# Technologies used for creating the tool

This tool is built with Python, utilizing Flask for the vulnerable web application, Tkinter for the GUI vulnerability checker, and Requests for HTTP communication.

# Steps to do:-

1.Install Required Libraries: Use pip, the Python package installer, to install the necessary libraries. 
2.Open the terminal and run the code "pip install Flask requests".
3.After installing the packages create the two folders for scanning the url and another targetting the url.
4.Once running the scanning code it will display one port url then we need to open in browser.
5.After that we need to run the another code then it will display like LFI vulnerabilities checker using GUI.
6.Then we need to paste the target URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/".
7.Then it will found the LFI vulnerabilities of targeted URL.
